This extension automates clicking through Facebook's user interface. While it respects Facebook's functionality, automated actions may be subject to rate limiting. Use responsibly and at your own discretion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### How It Works
Expunged uses Chrome's scripting API to:
1. Navigate to your Facebook activity log
2. Identify comment and reaction items
3. Click the "More options" menu for each item
4. Select "Delete" or "Unlike" option
5. Confirm deletion when prompted
6. Scroll to load more items
7. Repeat until all items are processed

### Smart Detection
- Filters out Messenger items to avoid accidental deletions
- Identifies comments on your own posts (when option enabled)
- Handles both immediate deletions and confirmation dialogs
- Includes delays to prevent Facebook rate limiting

### Built With
- Manifest V3 (latest Chrome extension standard)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- Chrome Extensions API
