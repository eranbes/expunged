## üîí Privacy & Security

### Your Data is Safe
- **No server communication** - Everything runs locally in your browser
- **No API keys required** - Works directly with Facebook's interface
- **No tracking or analytics** - We don't collect any data about you
- **Open source** - Review the code yourself for transparency

### Platform Terms of Service
This extension automates clicking through Facebook and TikTok's user interfaces. While it respects each platform's functionality, automated actions may be subject to rate limiting. Use responsibly and at your own discretion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### How It Works

**Facebook:**
- Uses Chrome's scripting API to inject deletion script
- Scrolls through activity page identifying items
- Clicks delete buttons and confirms deletions
- Filters out Messenger items and optionally own posts

**TikTok Reactions (Likes):**
- Navigates to profile ‚Üí Liked tab
- Opens first video in overlay viewer (no page reload!)
- Uses `setInterval` to repeatedly:
  - Click unlike button
  - Click arrow to next video
- Stays in viewer = fast and reliable

**TikTok Comments:**
- Uses persistent background script architecture
- Content script survives page navigations
- Orchestrates: Explore ‚Üí Video ‚Üí Delete ‚Üí Back to Explore
- Tracks processed videos to avoid infinite loops
- Finds only YOUR comments by matching username

### Smart Detection
- **Facebook**: Filters out Messenger items to avoid accidental deletions
- **Facebook**: Identifies comments on your own posts (when option enabled)
- **TikTok**: Automatic username detection from profile button
- **TikTok**: Uses stable `data-e2e` attributes for selectors
- **TikTok**: Skips videos already processed (prevents loops)
- **Both platforms**: Handles confirmation dialogs
- **Both platforms**: Includes delays to prevent rate limiting

### Built With
- Manifest V3 (latest Chrome extension standard)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- Chrome Extensions API
- Local storage for state persistence
- Modular platform architecture for easy extensibility

### Architecture
The extension uses a modular platform architecture with three different approaches:

**1. Simple Injection (Facebook, TikTok Likes)**
- Injects single cleanup function into page
- Works when no page navigation needed
- Fast and straightforward

**2. Background Orchestration (TikTok Comments)**
- `background.js` - Service worker that orchestrates
- `content-script.js` - Runs on all TikTok pages
- Survives page navigations
- Tracks state across pages

**3. Platform Modules** (`platforms/`)
- Each platform has its own file
- Platform registry for management
- Easy to add new platforms

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed technical documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load
- Ensure Developer mode is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Verify all files (especially icons) are in the folder
- Try reloading the extension

### Nothing Happens When I Click "Start Deleting"
- Make sure you've selected the correct platform (Facebook or TikTok)
- Verify you're on the correct activity/profile page for that platform
- Check that the green checkmark appears showing you're on the right page
- Reload the extension: go to `chrome://extensions/` and click reload

### Deletion Stopped Working
- The platform may have rate-limited you - wait 15-30 minutes and try again
- Refresh the page and restart the process
- Check your internet connection
- For TikTok: Make sure you're on your profile page and the content is visible

### Wrong Items Being Deleted
- Verify you've selected the correct platform button
- Verify you're on the correct activity page (Comments or Reactions)
- For Facebook: If using "exclude own posts" option, ensure it's checked before starting

### TikTok-Specific Issues
- **Content not found**: TikTok's DOM structure may have changed. Please report this as an issue on GitHub
- **Slow deletion**: TikTok has more conservative rate limiting than Facebook - this is normal
- **Private profile**: Make sure your liked videos are not set to private in settings
